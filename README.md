Convert coverage from the format outputted by [puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) to a format consumable by [Istanbul][istanbul].

## Usage

### to output coverage in Istanbul format with puppeteer

1. install _puppeteer-to-istanbul_, `npm i puppeteer-to-istanbul`.
2. run your code in puppeteer with coverage enabled:

    ```js
    const pti = require('puppeteer-to-istanbul')

    // Enable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
    await Promise.all([
      page.coverage.startJSCoverage(),
      page.coverage.startCSSCoverage()
    ]);
    // Navigate to page
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
    // Disable both JavaScript and CSS coverage
    const [jsCoverage, cssCoverage] = await Promise.all([
      page.coverage.stopJSCoverage(),
      page.coverage.stopCSSCoverage(),
    ]);
    const coverage = [...jsCoverage, ...cssCoverage];
    pti.write(jsCoverage)
    ```
        
### to run istanbul reports

1. install nyc, `npm i nyc`.
2. use nyc's report functionality:

    ```bash
    npm run report --reporter=html
    ```
    
_puppeteer-to-istanbul_ outputs temporary files in a format that can be
consumed by nyc.

see [istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/master/packages/istanbul-reports/lib) for a list of possible reporters.
